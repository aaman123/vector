Sample react python application that autosaves at regular intervals

# THOUGHT PROCESS.

A Bottom-approach was used to create a working application. Starting from defining routes and creating apis.

The process of development was as follows:

- Creating the server using starlette and FASTApi.
- Defining routes and creating controllers.
- Testing APIs using postman.
- Handling exceptions.-
- Intializing React Typescript project ( Typescript was used specifically for better management and concrete coding).
- Creating the UI using material-ui.
- Integration of Backend and Frontend using axios.
- Optimization of the APIs.

In today's world, Real Time Collaboration boards are getting more and more popular due to remote-first culture.
Each and every company wants their team to collaborate efficiently on tasks and code by pair programming. This makes 
RTC and ideal option for development.

I initially thought of using an in-memory cache like Redis to allow for extensive and fast database operations but I opted 
not to allow for more simplicity of the solution. This type of application can also use a pure serverless microservices 
architecture using the AWS stack and data streaming platforms like Kafka and Kinesis.
